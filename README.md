# ExploringTheMultiverse
A website whose code (except for one div element) was completely written by ChatGPT.

# A note about the links
It seems to me like the AI was trying to access actual articles about the multiverse, but didn't quite know their links. Here are some real articles that seem to match what the AI said...
1) Many-worlds interpretation (Wikipedia) is a real link to an actual, on-topic Wikipedia article.
2) Our Universe Is Probably Just One of Many Parallel Universes (Scientific American) was probably trying to link to [Why the Multiverse May Be the Most Dangerous Idea in Physics (Scientific American)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-multiverse-may-be-the-most-dangerous-idea-in-physics/)
3) The Multiverse Is a Scientific Fact, Not Just a Theory (Forbes) could be any of the almost infinite number of Forbes articles about the multiverse. I would recommend simply Googling "The Multiverse Is a Scientific Fact, Not Just a Theory (Forbes)" to see all of these articles!

# Prompts
1) Generate detailed HTML code for a one-page website devoted to exploring the multiverse.
2) Finish generating the webpage
3) Generate CSS, with a special cursive font and a pinkish theme, for this webpage.
